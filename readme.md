This repository contains code to transform .csv files exported from Mimsy into .csv files suitable for import into CollectionSpace via the cspace-converter.

This is a work in progress, and is based on one client's Mimsy data. I have no idea how much of this would be reusable on another Mimsy->CSpace migration.


To run:

```
bundle install
bundle exec ruby {cs_procedure/auth_type}.rb
```
